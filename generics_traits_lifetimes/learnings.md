1. we can constrain the generic types in rust by using traits to ensure comparison or mutation of the generic type is certainly not corrupting
2. There is overhead cost for generics as compiler does reverse lookup and generates code for concrete types from where the function is called. But what about call from libraries?
3. Traits are used to bound generic type to have certain behaviour, they are like interfaces but with some difference.
