1. Shadowing allows mutability in specific scope with the use of "let" keyword but variable will be immutable after the transformations we perform.
2. Another difference is, it allows type change, as it essentially declares new variable.
3. This allows us to overcome instances with only 1 variable where values properties like length is essential but two variables are needed to be used.
4. NOTE: if declared with mut, we cannot overshadow it; and it will be compile time error.
